What the wire looks like before any method call: the published packages, the frame shapes, the payload limits, and the Gateway-controlled WebRTC Talk contract.

## npm packages

Follow [Install the packages](/gateway/clients#install-the-packages) for the
verified stable release, exact-version commands, and compatibility guidance.
Package release versions are separate from the wire protocol version and the
root `openclaw` CLI release.

- [`@openclaw/gateway-protocol`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openclaw/gateway-protocol)
  publishes the schemas, validators, TypeScript types, lightweight frame and error
  helpers, and version constants. Its tarball includes the generated
  [`protocol.schema.json`](https://unpkg.com/@openclaw/gateway-protocol@2026.8.1/protocol.schema.json)
  machine-readable contract as a downloadable file, not an exported import subpath.
- [`@openclaw/gateway-client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openclaw/gateway-client)
  publishes the reference Node client and a browser-safe entry at
  `@openclaw/gateway-client/browser`.

For application lifecycle guidance, see
[Building a Gateway client](/gateway/clients). For apps
that supervise the Gateway as a child process, see
[Embedding OpenClaw](/gateway/embedding).

## Transport and framing

- WebSocket, text frames, JSON payloads.
- First frame **must** be a `connect` request.
- The default budget allows 128 outstanding unauthenticated connections per
  resolved client IP. Successful authentication or closure releases the slot.
  See [pre-auth connection limits](/gateway/security/rate-limiting#unauthenticated-websocket-connections)
  for shared-NAT behavior and the environment override.
- Pre-connect frames are capped at 64 KiB (`MAX_PREAUTH_PAYLOAD_BYTES`). After
  handshake, follow `hello-ok.policy.maxPayload` and
  `hello-ok.policy.maxBufferedBytes`. With diagnostics enabled, oversized
  inbound frames and slow outbound buffers emit `payload.large` events before
  the gateway closes or drops the frame. These events carry `surface`, byte
  sizes, limits, and a safe reason code, never message bodies, attachment
  contents, raw frame bytes, tokens, cookies, or secrets.
- The Gateway does not negotiate `permessage-deflate`. Browsers can compress
  even tiny requests when the extension is enabled; serial decompression then
  delays each request behind busy event-loop turns before handler scheduling.
  Uncompressed frames preserve responsive request bursts at the cost of more
  bandwidth for large histories and rosters. Payload limits are unchanged.

Frame shapes:

- Request: `{type:"req", id, method, params, traceparent?, expectedProfileId?}`
- Response: `{type:"res", id, ok, payload|error}`
- Event: `{type:"event", event, payload, seq?, stateVersion?, recipientProfileId?}`

Live text uses append deltas after an initial recipient snapshot. An outer event
sequence gap means a client may have lost part of that baseline: retire the
connection and reconnect before applying more deltas. If the frame revealing the
gap is a `chat` final, aborted, or error event, deliver its authoritative terminal
outcome and supplied complete snapshot before gap callbacks retire the connection.
This lets completed runs settle even when there will be no more live text to replay.
Renew session subscriptions
after reconnect; the Gateway sends a complete snapshot with the next text frame
for each observed run. Run-local payload sequences can skip numbers because text
is paced and coalesced; they are not the outer connection sequence.

Clients that share one connection among several views must keep reconstruction
with their local stream owner. A new local listener may join after the wire
snapshot was delivered to another view. Seed it from that owner's current state,
or deliver reconstructed local snapshots, and clear that state when its connection
or run retires. Durable history alone is not an ordered live-text baseline.

After authentication, a client may include a W3C `traceparent` string on each
request frame. The Gateway continues a valid value as a child trace context for
that request. Missing or syntactically malformed values within the
128-character field limit keep the default fresh request trace and do not fail
the RPC; longer values make the request frame invalid. The initial `connect`
request never establishes trace context for later frames. Use a separate
`traceparent` for each logical request on a long-lived connection; do not treat
the WebSocket itself as one trace.

Response errors use `{ code, message, details?, retryable?, retryAfterMs? }`.
Authenticated operator requests share a bounded queue for starting RPC handlers.
Ordinary requests have both aggregate and per-connection waiting limits, so
concurrent Control UI setup can queue without giving one connection the entire
request allowance. The aggregate serialized-byte bound still applies.
Small `sessions.messages.subscribe` requests without approval replay and
`sessions.messages.unsubscribe` requests have separate bounded waiting capacity,
including a per-connection limit. They keep the same FIFO order and yielding
budget as other requests. Roster snapshots and approval replay retain the ordinary
request budget.
When waiting capacity is exhausted, the Gateway returns retryable `UNAVAILABLE`
before the method runs; retry within the request's budget. Started requests
complete concurrently, so responses can arrive out of order.

During cooperative suspension, identity reads (`agent.identity.get`) wait in the
shared browser/CLI client for `gateway.suspension` with phase `accepting`. A
retryable `UNAVAILABLE` with `details.reason: "gateway-suspending"` also parks the
read, using `retryAfterMs` (60 seconds) as a fallback if the resume event is missed.
The original request deadline and cancellation still apply. Disconnects settle
pending reads normally and use the existing reconnect backoff. Writes are neither
parked nor replayed by this identity-read policy.

Ordinary UI/SDK requests may outlive a socket disconnect, but cannot start a
handler in a retiring Gateway instance. Shutdown fences new request entry and
joins pending handler loading and authorization before releasing their runtime.
Already-started methods retain their own shutdown behavior; shutdown does not
wait for every RPC to finish. Exact pending node progress and result replies
remain available during node cleanup, until transport shutdown seals entry.

Clients should branch on `code` and `details.code`; `message` remains human-readable
and can change except where a compatibility note says otherwise. Method-level
authorization failures use top-level `code: "FORBIDDEN"` with structured
missing-scope details:

- Missing scope: `{ code: "MISSING_SCOPE", missingScope, requiredScopes }`.
  `requiredScopes` is the complete known scope set for the requested operation.
  The legacy `missing scope: <scope>` message is retained for older clients.

Clients should read `details` first and use the legacy message only as a compatibility
fallback. `readMissingScopeError` and `readMissingScopeErrorDetails` are exported from
`@openclaw/gateway-protocol/gateway-error-details`; the browser-safe gateway client
re-exports them from `@openclaw/gateway-client/browser`.

The schemas are exported as `GatewayErrorDetailsSchema`,
`MissingScopeErrorDetailsSchema` from `@openclaw/gateway-protocol/schema`.
HTTP scope failures mirror the `MISSING_SCOPE` object under `error.details` and
use HTTP status `403`.

Side-effecting methods require idempotency keys (see schema).

### Profile binding

Use profile binding only when `hello-ok.features.capabilities` includes
`profile-binding-v1`. A client that requires this contract must report it as
unavailable when the capability is absent, rather than silently sending an
unbound action. Requests that omit `expectedProfileId` retain existing behavior.

`expectedProfileId` is an optional opaque string of 1 to 128 characters on an
authenticated request frame. The Gateway compares it exactly with the current
canonical profile ID of the authenticated principal. It does not trim, fold
case, or follow merge aliases on the expected value. Obtain the ID from
`users.self`; a Gateway URL, account label, agent ID, or session key is not a
profile ID. A missing authenticated profile cannot satisfy the precondition.

A server advertising the capability checks the precondition at RPC entry and
before returning a response payload. Commit-time revalidation is method-specific;
the capability does not promise atomicity inside arbitrary methods or plugins.
An entry check followed by asynchronous work is not itself a commit guarantee.

The structured error sets `error.details.reason` to `EXPECTED_PROFILE_MISMATCH`
and carries a per-attempt classification in `error.details.execution`:

- `not_started`: no execution was started by this attempt.
- `may_have_executed`: the method may have run before the mismatch was detected;
  the error is not evidence of rollback.

Neither classification clears uncertainty from an earlier attempt or overrides
a known acknowledgment (ACK). Preserve the original idempotency key and reconcile
the earlier outcome before retrying uncertain work. Ordinary socket disconnects
do not cancel already-accepted work.

On authenticated operator broadcasts, optional `recipientProfileId` identifies
the recipient's canonical profile at publication. It is a per-recipient frame
fact, not the event's origin, a run-owner identity, or an authorization grant.
Existing event permissions and subscriptions still govern delivery. Bind the
consumer to both its physical Gateway connection and selected profile; if the
recipient field is missing or differs, stop applying the event to that bound
view or action and surface the binding failure.

This contract does not cover pre-authentication events, node event delivery,
APNs notifications, or in-process publications. It does not revoke provider-direct
media or already-issued WebRTC credentials, and it does not promise immediate
revocation of retained sessions.

## Connection keepalives

Authenticated control connections use WebSocket ping/pong keepalives. These are
separate from [scheduled agent heartbeats](/gateway/heartbeat); disabling agent
heartbeats does not disable connection monitoring.

A ping queued behind outgoing data is governed by transport inactivity, including
partial write progress and incoming traffic. Once its write completes, the peer
gets a full 25-second pong window; unrelated incoming messages do not extend that
window. The periodic check closes expired connections and releases their owners.
Transport inactivity is not an independent write-only deadline: a peer sending
traffic can keep a queued write alive. Existing slow-consumer buffer limits still
apply. Streaming transports retain their stream-owner lifecycle policy.

## Operator HTTP transport

Already-paired operator clients can carry the same Gateway request, response,
and event frames over HTTPS instead of WebSocket. This is a transport building
block, not a complete standalone Apple Watch or Wear OS setup flow. Initial
pairing, native credential provisioning, and background execution are separate
client responsibilities.

Use `<basePath>/api/operator/connections`, where `basePath` is the configured
Control UI base path, or empty when none is configured. HTTPS is required except
on direct loopback. A trusted HTTPS proxy must forward `X-Forwarded-Proto: https`.
Requests and responses use JSON and `Cache-Control: no-store`; do not follow
redirects with credentials.

### Begin and authenticate

Send `POST` to the base route with `{}`. A `201` response contains:

```json validate=false
{
  "connectionId": "connection-id",
  "connectionKey": "connection-local-key",
  "challenge": { "nonce": "challenge-nonce", "ts": 1788912000000 },
  "handshakeExpiresAtMs": 1788912010000,
  "limits": {
    "maxPreauthPayloadBytes": 65536,
    "maxPayloadBytes": 26214400,
    "maxBufferedBytes": 52428800,
    "maxQueuedFrames": 256,
    "maxBatchFrames": 64,
    "maxPollWaitMs": 25000,
    "idleTimeoutMs": 60000,
    "maxConnections": 256
  }
}
```

Every subsequent request requires
`Authorization: Bearer <connectionKey>`. This random 256-bit key identifies one
in-memory connection; it is not a paired-device credential. Never put it in a
URL, cookie, or log. Begin does not authenticate the device.

Submit a standard signed `connect` frame to
`POST <base>/{connectionId}/frames`, using `challenge.nonce` for the device
signature. The signed POST supplies the actual authentication ingress. Its
envelope starts with `clientSeq: 1` and `ack: 0`:

```json validate=false
{
  "clientSeq": 1,
  "ack": 0,
  "frame": { "type": "req", "id": "connect", "method": "connect", "params": {} }
}
```

Replace `params` with the normal [signed connect parameters](/gateway/protocol/auth).
This transport requires `role: "operator"`, a signed device identity, and only
`auth.deviceToken`. Shared secrets, bootstrap tokens, and ambient proxy or
Tailscale identity cannot replace device-token verification. Connect does not
issue a new credential. Existing profile and session-access policy still applies;
deployments requiring a verified person cannot use a device token as that identity.

Requested and effective scopes are limited to `operator.read`, `operator.write`,
`operator.approvals`, and `operator.talk`. Admin, pairing, questions, and Talk
secret scopes are excluded. Methods use the ordinary Gateway authorization
policy; the transport does not maintain a separate RPC allowlist.

### Send, poll, and acknowledge

- Frame submission returns `202 { "acceptedClientSeq": 1 }`. This confirms
  sequence reservation, not RPC completion. Wait for this receipt before sending
  the next sequence; RPC responses may complete out of order.
- Retry an uncertain submission only on the same logical connection, with the
  same `clientSeq` and frame. The last accepted frame is deduplicated by JSON
  value, independent of object key order and envelope ACK. Gaps, older sequences,
  and conflicting retries return `409`.
- Poll with `POST <base>/{connectionId}/poll` and
  `{ "ack": 0, "waitMs": 25000 }`. Only one poll may be active. `waitMs: 0`
  returns immediately.
- A `200` poll returns `{acceptedClientSeq, frames:[{cursor,frame}]}`.
  Output cursors start at 1 and are unrelated to Gateway event `seq`.
  `hello-ok.server.connId` equals the begin response's `connectionId`.
- ACK is cumulative and monotonic; repeating it is allowed. It cannot exceed a
  cursor whose containing response finished writing. Unacknowledged output may
  replay; acknowledge only after processing it.
- `device.scopes.waitUpgrade` uses the existing external approval flow. Persist
  an approved replacement device token and its scopes **before ACK or reconnect**.
  Ordinary reapproval may rotate that token without closing the current narrow
  connection. Explicit token rotation, revocation, or device removal retires it
  and suppresses queued and replayable authenticated output.
- Cancelling a poll does not cancel an RPC. Server send completion means the
  containing HTTP response finished writing, not that output was enqueued or
  acknowledged. Repeated aborted writes eventually retire the connection.

Connections expire after 60 seconds without accepted transport activity.
The handshake has its own deadline reported by begin. Payload and buffer limits
match WebSocket limits; the queue additionally caps frame count and poll batches.
Begin shares the Gateway's per-client preauth budget, and at most 256 logical
HTTP connections, including retained closed connections, exist per runtime.

### Closure and recovery

`DELETE <base>/{connectionId>` returns `204` and retires the connection.
A poll can return `closed: {code, reason, resyncRequired: true}`. On closure,
overflow, or Gateway restart, create a new connection and resynchronize state.
Do not automatically replay an uncertain write across logical connections.

Transport errors have `{error:{code,message,resyncRequired?}}`. Common statuses
are `400` invalid envelope, `401` missing or invalid connection key, `403`
disallowed ingress or insecure transport, `404` missing/expired connection,
`409` sequence/ACK/poll conflict, `410` frame submission to a closed connection,
`413` payload limit, `408` body timeout, `429` connection capacity, and `503`
Gateway shutdown. RPC errors remain ordinary Gateway response frames.

Ingress is bound to the original client IP, listener attribution, Host, Origin,
and forwarding/scope headers. Network movement or a changed forwarding policy
closes the logical connection, even if the new path would be more trusted.
Reconnect with a fresh signed challenge; there is no network-handoff continuity
or promotion to local authority. Current origin policy is checked again after
awaited work and before dispatch and output.

Authenticated output is discarded on retirement, including hello and upgrade
grants. Only explicitly classified rejected-handshake output may remain briefly
available for terminal delivery. All connection keys, sequence state, and output
queues are in memory and are lost on restart.

## Gateway-controlled WebRTC Talk

`talk.client.create` accepts the additive capability `gateway-control-v1`.
The released browser/Gateway-owned WebRTC route tries OAuth first and falls
back to Platform API-key authentication. Direct backend sockets and unlisted
or private realtime routes require Platform API-key authentication. A
successful result includes
`clientControl: { owner: "gateway" }`, a 60-second single-use Gateway broker
token in `clientSecret`, and the relative
`offerUrl: "/plugins/openai/realtime/calls"`.

The client sends only `application/sdp` to that route with the broker token. It
must not create a provider control data channel. The Gateway creates the call,
attaches the provider sideband before returning the answer SDP, and owns tool,
transcript, steering, cancellation, and close lifecycle. Clients that omit the
capability retain the existing browser session behavior. A Gateway or
configured authentication path that cannot provide the requested owner returns
`UNAVAILABLE`; it never downgrades the request to client-owned control.

Clients must close their local media peer if the Gateway connection is lost or
a `talk.event` for their current `voiceSessionId` contains
`talkEvent.type: "session.closed"`. Ignore terminal events for other calls;
a recoverable `session.error` alone is not a close notification.
